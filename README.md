# Example Project for "AI-Driven Delivery Playbook"

## What is this project?

This repository is a demonstration of the **[AI-Driven Delivery Playbook](URL_TO_YOUR_PLAYBOOK_WIKI_OR_DOCS)** methodology. Its main goal is to clearly show how the principles and activities described in the playbook are applied in practice in a real product development cycle.

Every branch, commit, and Pull Request in this project directly corresponds to a specific activity from the playbook, which allows you to trace the entire path—from the initial idea to the finished implementation.

## About the Example Project: AI Planner "Localize"

As a practical example, this repository implements the **"Localize"** project—an intelligent travel planner.

**Problem:** Travelers spend dozens of hours planning trips, which causes stress and "planning fatigue."

**"Localize" Solution:** It is an AI service that automatically creates ready-made, logistically sound, and personalized itineraries. The user simply enters their wishes in free form (e.g., "I want to go to Rome for 7 days, interested in history and non-touristy restaurants"), and the system generates a detailed trip plan in minutes.

Thus, by following the commits and PRs in this repository, you will see how such a product is created in practice using the "AI-Driven Delivery Playbook" methodology.

## About the "AI-Driven Delivery Playbook" Methodology

The **AI-Driven Delivery Playbook** is a system created for the effective integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the development process. It is based on a **Context-Driven Development** approach.

The key idea is that the quality of results generated by AI assistants directly depends on the quality of the context provided to them. The analysis phases (Discovery, business analysis, system analysis) serve to form this context, which allows the AI to generate accurate and relevant code.

## How is this repository structured?

The repository structure fully reflects the process described in the playbook.

- **Documentation (`/doc`)**: This is where artifacts created in the early stages of the project (business requirements, system analysis, diagrams) are stored. These documents serve as the "context" for the AI.
- **Source Code (`/src`)**: This contains the application code, which was partially or fully generated by AI based on the documentation.
- **Commits and Pull Requests**: Every significant commit and PR has a link in its title or description to the corresponding activity in the playbook. This allows you to:
    1. Study the theoretical part of the activity in the playbook (e.g., "API Design").
    2. Open the related Pull Request in this repository and see the practical result (e.g., a ready-made OpenAPI specification).

## How to use this project?

1. **Choose an activity** that interests you in the "AI-Driven Delivery Playbook".
2. **Find the link** to the corresponding commit or Pull Request in this repository.
3. **Examine the changes**: see which files were created or modified, what code was written, and how the artifacts from the `/doc` folder were used to generate the code.

This way, you can clearly see how the theory from the playbook turns into practice.
