### 1. Market Sizing

| Metric | Market Volume | Key Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TAM** | **$1.34 billion** (World, 2024) | Global niche market for AI-generated travel itineraries. |
| **SAM** | **$2.2 - $2.5 billion** (USA, 2024) | Serviceable available market for AI planners in the target geography (USA). |
| **SOM** | **$4.6 million** (USA, 3-5 years) | Realistically achievable annual revenue for a startup in the first 3-5 years. |

*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
    The total global market for **AI-generated travel itineraries** in 2024 is **$1.34 billion**. This market is projected to grow to **$6.33 billion** by 2033, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.7% [3]. This segment is part of the larger "AI in Tourism" market, valued at $131.7 billion in 2023 with a forecast to grow to $2,903.7 billion by 2033 [1][2].

*   **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):**
    The US market is key in the adoption of AI in tourism, accounting for about 34.5% of the global market [2]. The AI in travel planning market in the US is projected to reach **$5.2 billion in 2025** and grow to $18.3 billion by 2032 [4][5]. Based on this, the serviceable available market for **AI travel planners** in the US is approximately **$2.2 - $2.5 billion** in 2024.

*   **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
    For a new startup, a realistic goal is to capture 0.1% - 0.5% of the SAM in the first 3-5 years. With a conservative estimate of 0.2% of the available market ($2.3 billion), the obtainable annual revenue (or GMV) for Wanderwise is **$4.6 million**. It is important to note that achieving this goal will be complicated by high market concentration: the top 3 players (Booking, Expedia, Airbnb) control about 50% of the entire online travel market [6][7].

### 2. Key Trends and Growth Drivers

**Main Trends:**

1.  **Hyper-personalization and AI Integration:** Consumers demand unique, individually tailored solutions. **72% of travelers** prioritize quality experience over the cost of the trip [8][9]. The integration of AI, which acts as a traveler's "co-pilot," stimulates interest in travel for **66% of users** [8].
2.  **Demand for Authentic and Sustainable Experiences:** Modern travelers, especially millennials, are actively seeking non-touristy, local experiences. At the same time, there is a growing demand for sustainability: **83% of tourists** consider sustainable travel important [12].
3.  **Dominance of the Mobile-First Experience:** Planning and navigation are increasingly shifting to smartphones. By 2029, it is expected that **73% of all bookings** will be made online, where mobile apps play a key role in providing personalized information on the fly [10][11].

**Growth Drivers:**

1.  **Active Recovery of the Tourism Industry:** A steady recovery is being observed post-pandemic. **92% of Americans** plan to travel in 2025, with an average travel budget of **$10,244** [13][8]. **56% of Americans** intend to travel even more than in previous years [13].
2.  **Technological Innovations:** The development of generative AI, machine learning, and real-time data analysis allows for the creation of products that solve the problem of information overload and offer a truly "seamless" user experience [10].

### 3. Barriers to Entry

1.  **Progressive Growth in Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Customer acquisition costs in the travel industry have increased by **35% from 2022 to 2025**, while the lifetime value of a customer (LTV) has only increased by 4.5%. This creates a serious **"economic imbalance that threatens profitability,"** especially for new players with limited budgets [14][15].
2.  **Dominance of Tech Giants:** The market is highly consolidated. **Booking Holdings, Expedia, and Airbnb control about 50% of the market**, possess huge databases, a loyal audience, and powerful network effects (e.g., Booking.com attracts **582.5 million visits monthly**) [16][6].
3.  **Difficulties in Attracting Investment:** Investors are showing increased caution towards B2C TravelTech startups due to market volatility, high CAC, and seasonality. It is indicative that of the **38 online travel companies that closed in 2024, 27 had only early-stage funding** [17][18].
4.  **Technological and Regulatory Complexity:** Creating a product requires the aggregation and constant updating of a huge volume of data, which is a complex engineering task. In addition, tightening data privacy legislation creates additional compliance costs [19][18][4].

### **Conclusion and Recommendations**

The market for AI travel planners in the US has significant financial potential and is perfectly aligned with current consumer trends towards personalization and unique experiences. **Wanderwise is targeting the right and growing niche.**

However, entering this market comes with extremely high barriers. Success will depend not on direct competition with giants, but on the product's ability to provide a significantly better planning quality and to focus on viral growth channels.

**The key strategic task is to prove that the AI-generated itinerary is so good that users will actively share it, thereby reducing the critical dependence on paid acquisition.**
