**Persona:** Olga Novikova, 29, "The Chief Planning Officer."
**Scenario:** Planning a 5-day trip to Lisbon with friends using the AI planner Localize.

---

### **Stage 1: Trigger and Problem Awareness**
*(Moment: From "Let's go to Lisbon!" to the start of active search)*

*   **Actions:**
    *   Creates a Telegram/WhatsApp chat "Lisbon in May üáµüáπ".
    *   Shares the first links to beautiful Instagram photos.
    *   Discusses dates and a rough budget with friends.
    *   Receives enthusiastic replies and confirmation that everyone is "in".

*   **Thoughts:**
    *   *"Great, everyone agreed! It's going to be fun!"*
    *   (5 minutes later) *"...Oh no. All the organizing is on me again. Where to stay? Where to go? How to fit it all in?"*
    *   *"Here come the endless links in the chat that you can never find later. Last time, we argued for half an hour on the street about where to have dinner."*
    *   *"I want to relax, not work as a guide and manager for my own friends."*

*   **Feelings:**
    *   ‚úÖ Excitement, anticipation.
    *   üîª Quickly turns into: anxiety, the burden of responsibility, slight irritation.

*   **Barriers:**
    *   **Mental Load:** The mere thought of the upcoming workload is demotivating.
    *   **Past Negative Experience:** Memories of chaos and arguments from previous trips.
    *   **Uncertainty:** It's unclear where to start to please everyone.

*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **Contextual Marketing:** Appear in her field of vision the moment this "pain" arises (e.g., targeted ads for users searching for flights or hotels in Lisbon).
    *   **Targeted Message:** Our main offer should scream: "Tired of being the chief planner? Delegate it to AI."

---

### **Stage 2: Search and Solution Selection**
*(Moment: Olga realizes that the old methods (Google Docs + chat) are not working for her)*

*   **Actions:**
    *   Googles "group trip planning app," "how to plan a trip for friends."
    *   Asks a more "advanced" friend or in a work chat for advice.
    *   Sees an ad for Localize on Instagram that promises to "create the perfect plan in 2 minutes."
    *   Goes to the App Store, reads the description, looks at screenshots, and a few reviews.

*   **Thoughts:**
    *   *"Google Docs is just a dumping ground for links. I need a living itinerary."*
    *   *"An AI planner? Sounds interesting. It probably just gives a list from TripAdvisor."*
    *   *"The reviews seem okay... 'Saved a ton of time' ‚Äî that's what I need. Okay, I'll try it, I can always delete it."*
    *   *"The main thing is that I don't have to spend an hour registering and filling out 100 fields."*

*   **Feelings:**
    *   ü§î Skepticism, distrust.
    *   üôè Hope for a "magic bullet."
    *   ‚è≥ Impatience (doesn't want to waste time learning a complex tool).

*   **Barriers:**
    *   **"App Fatigue":** Reluctance to download and learn yet another new app.
    *   **Distrust of AI:** Doubts that AI can create something truly unique and not generic.
    *   **Cost:** If the app is paid, this will be a major barrier at this stage.

*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **Simple Onboarding:** A minimal number of steps from download to getting the first value.
    *   **Clear Value Proposition:** Show on the first screen: "Just write what you want. We'll do the rest."
    *   **Social Proof:** Show reviews from other "Olgas."

### **Stage 3: First Use and "Aha! Moment"**
*(Moment: Olga enters her query into Localize for the first time)*

*   **Actions:**
    *   Opens the app. Skips the tutorial.
    *   Sees a simple interface with a text input field.
    *   Writes a query: "A 5-day trip to Lisbon for three. We love good food, beautiful views for photos, non-touristy places. We want to listen to fado. Medium budget."
    *   Watches the generation process.
    *   Receives a ready, step-by-step 5-day plan with a map, times, and descriptions.

*   **Thoughts:**
    *   *"Wow, is that all? No need to choose from 100 categories?"*
    *   *"Okay, let's see... Day 1... Day 2... It didn't just throw in some points, it logically connected them by neighborhood! This would have taken me half a day."*
    *   **AHA! MOMENT:** *"It found not only a popular restaurant but also a small family-run tavern praised in local blogs! And it even factored in travel time. Wow."*

*   **Feelings:**
    *   üòÆ Surprise.
    *   ü§© Amazement, joy.
    *   üòå Relief (feels that her problem is actually being solved).

*   **Barriers:**
    *   **Slow Generation:** If the process takes more than 1-2 minutes, the magic might fade.
    *   **Irrelevant Result:** If the AI provides a generic "top 10" from a guidebook, trust will be lost forever.
    *   **Complex Interface:** If the result is presented as a wall of text instead of an interactive map.

*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **Visualization:** Presenting the result immediately on an interactive map enhances the "Aha! moment."
    *   **Personalization:** In the description of each place, indicate why it's suitable for her ("Here you can take those Instagram photos," "Recommended by local food bloggers").
    *   **Wow Effect:** Add one "hidden gem" to the plan that she definitely wouldn't have found on her own.

### **Stage 4: Collaborative Planning and Approval**
*(Moment: The plan is ready, now it needs to be approved by her friends)*

*   **Actions:**
    *   Finds the "Share" button.
    *   Sends a link to the web version of the plan to the group chat.
    *   Her friends open the link and study the itinerary.
    *   One of her friends asks, "Hey, on Day 3, instead of the museum, can we go shopping?"
    *   Olga makes the change in the app, and the plan at the link updates automatically for everyone.

*   **Thoughts:**
    *   *"Finally, no need to forward 10 versions of a document or screenshots!"*
    *   *"Everything in one place, everything is clear. No one can say 'I didn't see it'."*
    *   *"I look super-organized, even though I only spent 10 minutes on this. Brilliant."*

*   **Feelings:**
    *   üí™ Confidence, control.
    *   üòé Pride in the result.
    *   ü§ù A sense of community and collaboration (instead of conflict).

*   **Barriers:**
    *   **Complicated Sharing:** If friends need to download the app to view the plan, it will create huge friction.
    *   **Lack of Interactivity:** If friends can't leave comments or see details.
    *   **Difficulty Editing:** If making one change ruins the entire logistics of the plan.

*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **"Guest" Web Access:** Seamless viewing of the plan via a link without registration.
    *   **Commenting Feature:** Allow friends to leave comments directly on the plan.
    *   **Smart Rebuilding:** When one item is replaced, the AI should automatically suggest logistical adjustments for the rest of the day.

### **Stage 5: The Trip (In-field Use)**
*(Moment: Olga and her friends are in Lisbon)*

*   **Actions:**
    *   Opens the day's plan in Localize every morning.
    *   Uses the built-in map to navigate to the next point.
    *   Suddenly, it starts to rain. Olga presses the "Adapt Plan" button.
    *   The app suggests replacing the walk along the waterfront with a visit to the nearby indoor Time Out Market.
    *   Tracks expenses in the built-in budget tracker.

*   **Thoughts:**
    *   *"It's so convenient that everything is on one map, no need to switch to Google Maps."*
    *   *"That 'adapt' feature just saved our day! We would have spent half an hour googling what to do."*
    *   *"I can finally relax and enjoy the trip instead of being the navigator."*

*   **Feelings:**
    *   üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Calm, confident.
    *   üéâ Joy from a smoothly running vacation.
    *   üôè Gratitude (to the app).

*   **Barriers:**
    *   **Poor Offline Performance:** Lack of internet can make the app useless.
    *   **Outdated Information:** Incorrect opening hours or addresses.
    *   **Rapid Battery Drain:** Active use of maps and GPS.

*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **"Magic Button" for Adaptation:** Our key feature during use.
    *   **Offline Maps and Plans:** Increases the app's reliability.
    *   **Push Notifications:** Useful tips ("Your table at the restaurant is in 15 minutes. Time to go").
    *   **Integration with Uber/Bolt:** A "Call a taxi to the next point" button.

### **Stage 6: Post-Trip: Loyalty and Recommendations**
*(Moment: Olga is back home)*

*   **Actions:**
    *   Her friends write in the chat: "Olga, that was the best trip! You're a super-organizer!"
    *   Olga proudly replies that it was thanks to the Localize app.
    *   Receives a push notification from the app: "How was your trip to Lisbon?". She leaves a glowing review in the App Store.
    *   Doesn't delete the app, knowing she'll be planning her next weekend getaway soon.
    *   Recommends Localize to a colleague who is going to Rome.

*   **Thoughts:**
    *   *"This was the best investment of money/time for the trip."*
    *   *"I will never plan trips any other way again."*
    *   *"Everyone should know about this app!"*

*   **Feelings:**
    *   üòä Satisfaction.
    *   üíñ Brand loyalty.
    *   üì£ Desire to share her discovery.

*   **Barriers:**
    *   **"One-time" Product:** If the app gives no reason to return, it will be deleted.
    *   **Lack of Post-trip Communication:** The app "forgets" about the user after the trip.

*   **Opportunities:**
    *   **Create a "Travel Archive":** Save past itineraries as beautiful memories.
    *   **Loyalty/Referral Program:** "Invite a friend and get a discount on your next plan."
    *   **Smart Recommendations:** "Liked Lisbon? You might also like Porto. Create a plan?".
