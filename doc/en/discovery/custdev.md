## **Customer Development Interview Report (CustDev)**

**Product:** Localize (AI Travel Planner)
**Interviews Conducted:** 6
**Segment:** Independent travelers, 25-40 years old, who have planned at least 2 trips in the last year.

---

### Hypotheses Tested:
1.  **Problem:** Users spend too much time (10+ hours) on planning.
2.  **Problem:** Existing tools do not create a coherent, optimized itinerary.
3.  **Value:** Users are willing to pay to save time and for a quality plan.

### 1. Key Confirmed Problems

- **Problem #1: "Stitching together" disparate information is the main pain point.**
  All 6 out of 6 respondents confirmed that the most tedious part is not finding places, but combining them into a single, logical plan.
  > *"I have 20 tabs open: Google Maps to see where it is, TripAdvisor for reviews, some blog with 'secret spots,' and the museum's website to check opening hours. Putting it all together into a one-day itinerary is hell. I just give up and decide to figure it out on the spot."*

- **Problem #2: Fear of missing out and the "tired planner effect."**
  5 out of 6 respondents mentioned that after a few hours of planning, they get tired and start adding standard, "touristy" places to the plan, losing their initial enthusiasm to find something unique.
  > *"For the first two hours, you look for something authentic, and then you think, 'To hell with it, I'll just go to the main square.' There's no energy left for optimization."*

- **Problem #3: Existing solutions are "directories," not "planners."**
  Respondents actively use Google Maps, TripAdvisor, and blogs, but perceive them as passive databases. They do not actively help in building and optimizing an itinerary.
  > *"Google Travel tries, but it just throws everything into a pile. It doesn't tell me the best way to structure my day to avoid running from one end of the city to the other."*

### 2. Current Solutions (How they cope now)

- **Main tool: Google My Maps + Google Docs/Notion.** 4 out of 6 respondents create a custom map in Google My Maps where they pin all interesting points, and keep text notes in a separate document. This is a completely manual process.
- **Screenshots and notes on the phone.** 2 out of 6 just take screenshots of maps and Instagram posts and save them chaotically, hoping to figure it out on the spot.
- **Buying ready-made PDF guides from bloggers.** One respondent mentioned buying a ready-made guide, but it was inflexible and did not take into account his personal interests.

### 3. Important Insights

- **"Vibe" is more important than rating.** When choosing places (especially restaurants and bars), respondents care less about the rating (4.5 vs 4.7) and more about the atmosphere, the "vibe" of the place, which they try to catch from photos in blogs and social media.
- **Weather is a key factor.** All respondents mentioned that their plans were often ruined by the weather, and they did not have a ready "plan B."
- **Willingness to pay exists, but not for a subscription.** 5 out of 6 respondents were skeptical about the idea of a monthly subscription for a planner they use 2-3 times a year. However, they expressed a willingness to **pay a one-time fee for a quality plan** for a specific trip ($5 to $15).

### 4. Conclusions and Next Steps

1.  **The hypothesis about time loss is confirmed.** The problem is real and acute.
2.  **The hypothesis about the lack of a coherent itinerary is confirmed.** This is a key frustration.
3.  **The value hypothesis is partially confirmed.** Users value the solution, but the subscription business model raises doubts. A per-trip plan payment model should be considered.

**Recommendation:** Focus the value proposition on **"creating a logistically convenient and atmospheric plan in minutes."** Prototype a solution with a one-time purchase model.
