### **Part 1: MVP Features (MoSCoW)**

#### **Must-have**
*   **Generate itinerary from a text query:** Solves the main user "pain" â€” eliminates manual planning.
*   **View itinerary on a map and as a list:** Allows for a clear view of the plan both geographically and as a sequence of steps.
*   **User registration and authentication:** Necessary for saving generated plans.

#### **Should-have**
*   **Ability to edit the itinerary (delete points):** Gives the user flexibility and control, significantly increasing value.
*   **Save itineraries to the user profile:** Creates a reason to return to the product.

#### **Could-have**
*   **Share itinerary via a public link:** A potential channel for viral growth.
*   **Responsive design for mobile devices:** Improves usability during a trip.

#### **Won't-have (for this release)**
*   **Collaborative itinerary editing:** A technically complex feature for future versions.
*   **Offline mode:** Requires significant resources; an online version is sufficient for the start.
