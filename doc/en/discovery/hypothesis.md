#### **1. Problem Hypotheses**
*These are assumptions that the problem truly exists, is important, and that we understand its essence correctly.*

**Hypothesis P1:** We believe that **modern independent travelers (25-45 years old)** spend an average of **more than 10 hours** on detailed planning for a single trip of 3-7 days, and this causes them significant stress and "planning fatigue."

**Hypothesis P2:** We believe that the **main difficulty** for travelers is not finding individual points of interest (restaurants, museums), but **synthesizing them into a logistically optimal and coherent daily itinerary**.

**Hypothesis P3:** We believe that travelers experience **"analysis paralysis"** due to the need to compare and verify information from 5+ disparate sources (blogs, maps, reviews, social media).

**Hypothesis P4:** We believe that the fear of missing out on something important or creating a "less-than-perfect" itinerary (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out) is a **key emotional barrier** that makes planning tedious.

#### **2. Solution Hypotheses**
*These are assumptions that our features will actually solve the stated problems and be in demand.*

**Hypothesis S1:** We believe that users will prefer **a single, AI-generated itinerary** that can be refined, rather than just a list of recommended places from which they have to build a plan themselves.

**Hypothesis S2:** We believe that the ability to **adapt the itinerary "on the fly"** (e.g., in case of bad weather) is a critically important feature that will create a sense of control and security, not just a "nice-to-have."

**Hypothesis S3:** We believe that users will actively use a **built-in budget tracker** not only for initial estimation but also for tracking expenses *during* the trip, if it is integrated into the main itinerary.

**Hypothesis S4:** We believe that an **interactive map with plotted routes** is a more valuable and convenient format for following an itinerary than a static text plan with addresses.

#### **3. Value Hypotheses**
*These are assumptions about the main value we provide and whether customers are willing to pay for it.*

**Hypothesis V1:** We believe that the **main value** for users is **radical time savings** (from 10+ hours to a few minutes), and they are willing to **pay** for this convenience.

**Hypothesis V2:** We believe that users will consider AI-generated itineraries based on their queries to be sufficiently **"personalized" and "authentic,"** and will not perceive them as "robotic" or "generic."

**Hypothesis V3:** We believe that the main "wow effect" and key value will be created by the **quality and non-obviousness of the recommendations** (e.g., a "little-known workshop"), and not just by logistical optimization.

#### **4. Market Hypotheses**
*These are assumptions about our audience, its acquisition channels, and our place in the market.*

**Hypothesis M1:** We believe that our target audience **actively seeks travel inspiration and advice** on social media (Instagram, TikTok) and on thematic travel blogs, making these effective channels for our promotion.

**Hypothesis M2:** We believe that there is a segment of independent travelers **willing to pay for a premium planning experience** (e.g., through a subscription or a one-time fee per plan) to save their time and get a high-quality result.

**Hypothesis M3:** We believe that our key advantage over free tools (Google Maps, TripAdvisor) is the **deep integration of all stages** (search -> synthesis -> routing -> budgeting -> adaptation), which creates enough value to switch.

**Hypothesis M4:** We believe that users will **actively share generated plans** with their travel companions (friends, partners), which can become an important organic channel for acquiring new users (virality).
