# Definition of Done (DoD) for the AI Guide Project

---

## 1. Code Quality

- Code meets standards (linting, formatting)
- Code review conducted for all critical modules
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of the AI module's functionality
- API and internal function documentation is updated

---

## 2. Testing

- Integration and end-to-end tests have passed
- Correctness of itinerary generation tested across different scenarios and budgets
- UX/UI testing performed on all supported devices
- All critical bugs identified by QA have been fixed

---

## 3. Documentation

- User guide for using the AI guide has been created
- Release notes updated with descriptions of new features
- Internal documentation for the development team is up-to-date

---

## 4. Business Goals

- AI generates itineraries that match the user's interests and budget
- Itinerary personalization is implemented (travel style, activity level, gastronomy)
- The system collects basic usage metrics (MAU, LTV, CAC) for performance analysis

---

## 5. Release Readiness

- CI/CD pipeline is set up for automatic builds and deployment
- Product functionality verified on staging and production environments
- Security and user data protection testing has been conducted
- The task/feature is accepted by the product owner and ready for release

## DoD Table for Different Task Types

| Task Type          | Code Quality | Testing      | Documentation | Business Goals | Release Readiness |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Feature            | Mandatory    | Mandatory    | Mandatory     | Mandatory      | Mandatory         |
| Bug Fix            | Optional     | Mandatory    | Optional      | Optional       | Mandatory         |

 **Conclusion:**
The DoD provides the team with clear criteria for closing tasks and releasing functionality. Every module of the AI guide, every new feature, and every bug fix undergoes the same verification process, which minimizes risks and improves product quality.
