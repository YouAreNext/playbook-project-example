# Product Requirements Document: Localize MVP v1.0

*   **Owner:** [Product Manager Name]
*   **Last Updated:** 2025-09-10
*   **Status:** Approved for Development

## 1. Introduction

**1.1. Problem Statement:** Modern travelers spend 10 to 20 hours planning a single trip, drowning in information noise from blogs, reviews, and maps. This process causes stress and "planning fatigue," turning vacation preparation into a job. The market lacks tools that offer a holistic, personalized, and automated solution to this problem.

**1.2. Proposed Solution:** "Localize" is an intelligent travel planner that uses AI to create personalized itineraries in minutes. The user inputs their interests, budget, and dates in free-form text, and the system generates a ready-to-use, logistically sound, and context-rich trip plan.

**1.3. Product Vision:** To become an indispensable "pocket guide" for modern travelers, making the planning process as enjoyable as the trip itself and helping to discover the world from unexpected angles.

## 2. Goals and Metrics

**2.1. Business Goals:**
*   Validate the hypothesis that users are willing to pay for high-quality travel planning automation (target: 5% paying users from the active base within 3 months).
*   Achieve 1,000 monthly active users (MAU) in the first 3 months after launch.

**2.2. Product Goals:**
*   Ensure a high level of satisfaction with the first generated itinerary (rating of 4/5 or higher from 70% of users).
*   Achieve a conversion rate from registration to first itinerary creation of 80%.

**2.3. Key Metrics (KPIs):**
*   **North Star Metric:** Number of user-saved generated itineraries.
*   **Leading Metrics:**
    *   Weekly user registrations.
    *   1st and 4th-week Retention Rate.
    *   Average quality score of a generated itinerary (on a scale of 1 to 5).

## 3. Users

**3.1. Target Audience:**
*   **"Busy Professionals" (30-45 years old):** Value their time, are willing to pay for convenience, and seek efficient solutions to optimize their lives, including vacations.

**3.2. Key User Scenario (for MVP):**
*   Arthur ("Busy Professional") is preparing for a 7-day trip to Rome. He finds the Localize website through a recommendation. He enters a query in the text box: "I want to go to Rome for 7 days in October. Interested in history, non-touristy restaurants with good pasta. Medium budget. Relaxed pace." He registers via Google, and within 15 seconds, receives a detailed plan. The plan is broken down by day, shown on a map, and as a list. Arthur is satisfied with the result and saves the itinerary to his profile.
